title={Uncrewed surface vehicles in the Global Ocean Observing System: a new frontier for observing and monitoring at the air-sea interface},

journal={Frontiers in Marine Science},
abstract={Observing air-sea interactions on a global scale is essential for improving Earth system forecasts. Yet these exchanges are challenging to quantify for a range of reasons, including extreme conditions, vast and remote under-sampled locations, requirements for a multitude of co-located variables, and the high variability of fluxes in space and time. Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) present a novel solution for measuring these crucial air-sea interactions at a global scale. Powered by renewable energy (e.g., wind and waves for propulsion, solar power for electronics), USVs have provided navigable and persistent observing capabilities over the past decade and a half. In our review of 200 USV datasets and 96 studies, we found USVs have observed a total of 33 variables spanning physical, biogeochemical, biological and ecological processes at the air-sea transition zone. We present a map showing the global proliferation of USV adoption for scientific ocean observing. This review, carried out under the auspices of the ‘Observing Air-Sea Interactions Strategy’ (OASIS), makes the case for a permanent USV network to complement the mature and emerging networks within the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). The Observations Coordination Group (OCG) overseeing GOOS has identified ten attributes of an in-situ global network. Here, we discuss and evaluate the maturation of the USV network towards meeting these attributes. Our article forms the basis of a roadmap to formalise and guide the global USV community towards a novel and integrated ocean observing frontier.

  abstract={The Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) is a NASA Earth Ventures Suborbital investigation designed to test the hypothesis that oceanic frontogenesis and the kilometer-scale (“submesoscale”) instabilities that accompany it make important contributions to vertical exchange of climate and biological variables in the upper ocean. These processes have been difficult to resolve in observations, making model validation challenging. A necessary step toward testing the hypothesis was to make accurate measurements of upper-ocean velocity fields over a broad range of scales and to relate them to the observed variability of vertical transport and surface forcing. A further goal was to examine the relationship between surface velocity, temperature, and chlorophyll measured by remote sensing and their depth-dependent distributions, within and beneath the surface boundary layer. To achieve these goals, we used aircraft-based remote sensing, satellite remote sensing, ships, drifter deployments, and a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The observational component of S-MODE consisted of three campaigns, all conducted in the Pacific Ocean approximately 100-km west of San Francisco during 2021–23 fall and spring. S-MODE was enabled by recent developments in remote sensing technology that allowed operational airborne observation of ocean surface velocity fields and by advances in autonomous instrumentation that allowed coordinated sampling with dozens of uncrewed vehicles at sea. The coordinated use of remote sensing measurements from three aircraft with arrays of remotely operated vehicles and other in situ measurements is a major novelty of S-MODE. All S-MODE data are freely available, and their use is encouraged.},

  title={Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler Measurements from Saildrones, with Applications to Submesoscale Studies},
   bibtex_show={true},
  abstract ={Characterizing submesoscale ocean processes requires high-resolution observations in both space O(1\,km) and time O(1\,hr). Resolving their velocity gradients requires velocity accuracies of O(1\,cm/s).
In the present analysis, we utilize multiple mobile platforms, including Saildrones (SDs), to achieve high-resolution measurements of submesoscale features. We assess Saildrone Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements against shipboard ADCP data, both collected during the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE). 
The results show that the standard 5-minute average Saildrone ADCP along-track velocity difference variability (3\,cm/s) is consistent with shipboard ADCP, considered
in the present study as a reference.
However, direct ADCP comparisons between a Saildrone and the R/V \textit{Oceanus} give small mean difference ($\sim$1\,cm/s).  The mean difference could stem from spatial inhomogeneities rather than surface waves, whose influence is expected to be negligible at most sampled depths.
Based on 1\,Hz Saildrone ADCP data,
we found that averaging over 3 minutes of ADCP-derived currents (250\,m
in space) provides minimal unwanted signal. We investigate the uncertainty of submesoscale current gradients derived from Saildrone ADCP measurements and find that the velocity gradient at a 2\,km scale can be obtained with a 0.1$f$ uncertainty using four Saildrones. 
 The methodologies we developed to ascertain optimal averaging window are versatile and applicable to other uncrewed surface vehicles (USV) or multiple-ship arrays.},

%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
